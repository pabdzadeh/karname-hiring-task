This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project for [Karnameh](https://karnameh.com/) recruiting process. 

The design is accessible here: [https://www.figma.com/file/cuXoYkQzy4XawkLAdpAtDA/QA---Karnameh?node-id=4%3A485&mode=dev](https://www.figma.com/file/cuXoYkQzy4XawkLAdpAtDA/QA---Karnameh?node-id=4%3A485&mode=dev).

The project is deployed on Vercel and can be found in [https://karname-hiring-task.vercel.app/](https://karname-hiring-task.vercel.app/). Hence, the CI/CD is available on this project and everything pushed to `master` branch will be deployed automatically.

I have used React-Query, React-Hook-Form, Material UI, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Next 13. Also, json-server has been used  for a simple back-end simulation and it is deployed on glitch [https://veiled-ninth-iguana.glitch.me/](https://veiled-ninth-iguana.glitch.me/). 



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
